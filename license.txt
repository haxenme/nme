Libraries required to compile the "NDLL" for each platform fall under 
their own licenses, generally the MIT, BSD and zlib licenses. The
notable exception to this is SDL 1.2, which uses the LGPL license.

NME uses SDL for Windows, Mac, Linux and BlackBerry. The NDLL for these
platforms should be considered LGPL, but since the NDLL files are
loaded at runtime, these will not affect NME applications compiled
for these platforms.

webOS uses SDL, but dynamically-linked, so the NDLL is unaffected.

Applications compiled for iOS are statically-linked, as currently
required by Apple, but since NME does not use SDL with iOS, you 
should still retain full rights to your application code.

Large portions of the API documentation have been adapted from the 
open-source Flex SDK documentation under the Mozilla Public License.

The NME project waives any requirement to distribute this copyright
notice with anything other than substantial portions of the source code.
