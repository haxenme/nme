Version 1.0: first public release.
Version 1.1: fixed bug to set *error to FLI_OK when returning successfully from FLI_Open
             added function FLI_Reset to reset the animation to the first frame
Version 1.2: added function FLI_Skip to skip the current frame without rendering
             FLI_Animation->surface is now correctly locked and unlocked
             the rwops stream is now part of the FLI_Animation structure and is closed inside FLI_Close
             renamed FLI_Reset to FLI_Rewind
             added function FLI_Version that returns the library version
