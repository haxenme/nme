 *  
 *  http://www.libsdl.org/
 *  
 *  \section intro_sec Introduction
 *  
 *  This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low
 *  level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
 *  and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.
 *  
 *  The current version supports Linux, Windows, Windows CE, BeOS, MacOS,
 *  Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, IRIX, and QNX.
 *  The code contains support for AIX, OSF/Tru64, RISC OS, and SymbianOS,
 *  but these are not officially supported.
 *  
 *  SDL is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to
 *  several other languages, including Ada, C#, Eiffel, Erlang, Euphoria,
 *  Guile, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Lua, ML, Objective C, Pascal, Perl, PHP,
 *  Pike, Pliant, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.
 *  
 *  This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
 *  found in the file  "COPYING".  This license allows you to use SDL
 *  freely in commercial programs as long as you link with the dynamic
 *  library.
 *  
 *  The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
 *  the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
 *  The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
 *  More documentation is available in HTML format in "docs/index.html", and
 *  a documentation wiki is available online at:
 *  	http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi
 *  
 *  The test programs in the "test" subdirectory are in the public domain.
 *  
 *  Frequently asked questions are answered online:
 *  	http://www.libsdl.org/faq.php
 *  
 *  If you need help with the library, or just want to discuss SDL related
 *  issues, you can join the developers mailing list:
 *  	http://www.libsdl.org/mailing-list.php
 *  
 *  Enjoy!
