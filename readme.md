NME
===

NME is a game and application framework that currently targets Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Flash, HTML5, while providing legacy support for webOS.

Developers can create applications for all supported platforms with the same source code. The mobile and desktop targets are fully native -- no scripting language or virtual machine is used. This allows for greater compatibility with additional libraries and for ideal performance.

More information is available at http://www.nme.io


Download
========

You can get an installer for Windows, Mac or Linux at http://www.nme.io/download


Source
======

If you would like to use NME from the source, follow these steps:

 1. Clone NME to a new directory (like "C:\Development\Haxe\nme")

 2. Run "haxelib dev nme path/to/your/clone"

 3. If you are on Windows, use the above steps to also clone the "nmedev" repository. Otherwise use "haxelib git nmedev https://github.com/haxenme/nmedev.git"

 4. Run "haxelib install" for format, hxcpp, svg, swf and xfl


You must have Haxe 3 and Neko 2 installed.

We will attemp to keep nmedev up-to-date with binaries so you can get started without compiling. However, to be current (or if you contributing), you may need to recompile the tools or platform binaries from time-to-time.

NME includes a "rebuild" command to make this simple:

	nme rebuild tools,windows


The "rebuild" command accepts a comma-delimited list of targets among the following: "android", "blackberry", "clean", "ios", "linux", "mac", "tools", "webos" and "windows"

The requirements to build for one of these platforms will be similar to when you target the platform from a release build. You can find more details on the [download page](http://www.nme.io/download).
