NME
===

NME is a game and application framework that currently targets Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Flash, HTML5, while providing legacy support for webOS.

Developers can create applications for all supported platforms with the same source code. The mobile and desktop targets are fully native -- no scripting language or virtual machine is used. This allows for greater compatibility with additional libraries and for ideal performance.

========

You can get an installer for Windows, Mac or Linux at http://www.nme.io/download


Source
======

It is recommended that you install a release version of NME before working from the source.

You may clone or fork this repository. Next, you should run "haxelib dev nme (path to checkout directory)" in order to tell haxelib where your development version is located.

Source distributions do not include the binaries for the NME command-line tools or native libraries. You will need to compile them first.

NME includes a "rebuild" command to make this more convenient. Use "nme rebuild tools" to compile the command-line tools, or "nme rebuild windows" to compile the platform binary for Windows.


The "rebuild" command accepts a comma-delimited list of targets, including "android", "blackberry", "clean", "ios", "linux", "mac", "tools", "webos" and "windows"
